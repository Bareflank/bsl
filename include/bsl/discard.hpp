    ///     the same as executing a static cast. The reason this exists is
    ///     it better documents the intent to discard the result of a function
    ///     or an intentionally unused parameter. This function also exists
    ///     because in some cases, we must pass the address of a discard as
    ///     as a template parameter, which cannot be done with a static cast.
